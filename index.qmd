::: {#hero-heading}

I am a physician, scientist, and infectious disease fellow.   

My current research focus is [determining how herpes viruses control gene expression](research/CMV/index.qmd).  

I love caring for patients. [However, healthcare only intervenes after political-economic forces have driven disease](blog/blog.qmd); and [healthcare objectifies patients for financial gain and resource extraction](blog/blog.qmd).
