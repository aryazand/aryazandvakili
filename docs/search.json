Until recently Iowa Medicaid only paid for hepatitis C DAAs when prescribed by either Hepatology or Infectious Disease specialists. Recently, this rule was relaxed to allow other clinicians to prescribe DAAs just in “collaboration” with a specialists. This rule-change provided an opportunity for the University of Iowa addiction medicine clinic to prescribe DAAs to their patients with chronic hepatitis C.\nFor this project, we compared time-to-treatment when the addiction medicine clinicians to treat Hepatitis C directly to referring to a specialists."
