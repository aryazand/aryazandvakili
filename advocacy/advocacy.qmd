## Single-Payer Healthcare Financing

I am a proponent of single-payer healthcare financing because: 

- it is universal (everybody has access to the same benefits)  
- it is more economical than multi-payer and for-profit health insurance
- it reduces financial harm to patients 
- it reduces bureaucracy 

For these reasons, I started a Chapter of "Students for a National Health Program" in medical school and an Iowa chapter of Physicians for a National Health Program.
