Here we are study the impact of treating hepatitis C within an Addiction Medicine 
clinic. 

Due exorbitant costs, Iowa Medicaid restricts insurance coverage for direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) therapy. Until recently Iowa Medicaid only paid for hepatitis C DAAs 
when prescribed by either Hepatology or Infectious Disease specialists. Recently, this rule
was relaxed to allow other clinicians to prescribe DAAs just in "collaboration" with a specialists. 
This rule-change provided an opportunity for the University of Iowa addiction medicine clinic to
prescribe DAAs to their patients with chronic hepatitis C. 

For this project, we compared time-to-treatment when the addiction medicine clinicians 
to treat Hepatitis C directly to referring to a specialists.
